            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>TechNest</strong> — your hub for exploring, sharing, and discussing the latest in
                technology, development trends, and innovation.
                TechNest was built as a passion project by <strong>Madhu Mohan</strong>, a full-stack developer
                dedicated to creating platforms that connect people through technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project is a part of my professional portfolio, showcasing my skills in full-stack web development
                using
                <strong>Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS</strong>.
                It features a secure authentication system, blog creation tools, like functionality, and a clean,
                responsive UI.
            </p>

            <p>
                My mission with TechNest is to create a space where tech enthusiasts can:

                <li>Engage with the community through likes and feedback</li>
            </ul>
